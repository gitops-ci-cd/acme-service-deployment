# Skills

This directory contains skills - domain-specific knowledge packages that enable AI assistants to perform specialized tasks. Each skill is defined in its own subdirectory with a `SKILL.md` file containing structured instructions, usage examples, and implementation details.

Skills allow AI tools to understand and execute complex workflows by providing context-specific guidance for particular domains or operations.
